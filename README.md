# Introduction

> üëâ New to Pipelex? Check out the [main repository](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex) to learn more!

The **Pipelex MCP Server** implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to enable AI agents to interact with [Pipelex](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex) as a native tool. This bridges the gap between conversational AI and structured, repeatable AI workflows.

With this MCP server, AI agents can:
- **Build pipelines from natural language descriptions**
- **Execute pipelines with specific inputs**
- **Receive structured outputs** ready for downstream tasks

To learn more about MCP, check out the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) from Anthropic.

# üåü Key Features

**üéØ Natural Language Pipeline Creation**

Simply tell your AI agent what you need:

> "Build me a pipeline that extracts the buyer's name from a purchase receipt, then validates the email format."

The agent will construct the pipeline definition and execute it with your inputs‚Äîall in one conversation.

**üîß Two Powerful Tools**

1. **`pipe_builder`**: Constructs pipeline definitions from natural language
2. **`pipe_runner`**: Executes pipelines with structured inputs

**üöÄ Works with Any MCP Client**

- Cursor
- Claude Desktop
- Any MCP-compatible client (not tested yet)

# üöÄ Quick Start

## Prerequisites

- **Python** >=3.11,<3.12
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** package manager

### Installing uv

If you don't have `uv` installed:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Verify installation
uv --version
```

After installation, get the full path to `uv` (you'll need this for MCP configuration):

```bash
which uv
```

Keep this path handy‚Äîyou'll use it in your MCP client configuration.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-mcp.git
cd pipelex-mcp
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
make install
```

## API Key Configuration

### Get Your Pipelex Inference API Key

The MCP server requires a **Pipelex Inference API key** to execute pipelines.

**Get a free API key ($20 in free credits):**

1. Join our [Discord community](https://go.pipelex.com/discord)
2. Request your API key in the [üîë„Éªfree-api-key](https://discord.com/channels/1369447918955921449/1418228010431025233) channel

### Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp server/.env.example server/.env

# Edit server/.env and add your API key
# PIPELEX_INFERENCE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

> **Note:** For advanced configuration (bring your own API keys, custom backends), see the [Pipelex API Key Configuration](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex#api-key-configuration) guide.

# üîå Client Setup

## Cursor

Cursor has **built-in MCP support**. The configuration file is located at `.cursor/mcp.json` in your workspace.

### Configuration

Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` (create it if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipelex": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/pipelex-mcp",
        "run",
        "pipelex-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PIPELEX_INFERENCE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:**
- Replace `/path/to/uv` with the result of `which uv`
- Replace `/absolute/path/to/pipelex-mcp` with the full path to your cloned repository
- Replace `your-api-key-here` with your Pipelex Inference API key

**Example:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipelex": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/Users/yourname/projects/pipelex-mcp",
        "run",
        "pipelex-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PIPELEX_INFERENCE_API_KEY": "plx_abc123..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

After configuration, simply chat with Cursor:

> "Build me a pipeline to extract email addresses from text and validate them."

Cursor will automatically invoke the Pipelex MCP tools to build and execute the pipeline.

[Learn more about MCP in Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)

## Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop also supports MCP through its configuration file.

### Configuration

1. **Open Claude Desktop Settings:**
   - Click **Claude** in the menu bar ‚Üí **Settings‚Ä¶**
   - Navigate to **Developer** tab
   - Click **Edit Config**

2. **Edit the configuration file:**

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipelex": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", "/absolute/path/to/pipelex-mcp",
        "run",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "server.main", 
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

**Important:**
- Replace `/path/to/uv` with the result of `which uv`
- Replace `/absolute/path/to/pipelex-mcp` with the full path to your cloned repository
- Replace `your-api-key-here` with your Pipelex Inference API key

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely


For more detailed setup instructions, see the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers).

## Other Clients

MCP is an open protocol. Any client that implements MCP can use this server. Check the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for a full list of compatible clients.

# üí° Examples

## Example 1: CV-Job Matching & Interview Question Generation

**Use Case:** Automatically analyze how well a candidate's CV matches a job offer and generate relevant interview questions.

### What it does:

1. Extracts text from a CV PDF
2. Analyzes alignment between CV and job requirements
3. Generates targeted interview questions based on gaps and strengths
4. Compiles everything into a comprehensive interview preparation document

### How to use it:

Simply tell your AI agent:

> "Build me a pipeline that takes a CV PDF and a job offer text, then generates interview questions based on the candidate's alignment with the role."

Then provide:

```
Inputs:
- CV PDF: https://example.com/sample-cv.pdf
- Job Offer Text: "GenAI Engineer at Pipelex (Paris)
  
  We're growing our team of AI engineers in Paris to build our Agentic Knowledge Framework.
  
  Key requirements:
  - Strong Python skills
  - Experience with LLMs and AI frameworks
  - Ability to ship fast and iterate
  - Knowledge of software architecture
  - Passion for building developer tools
  
  ..."
```

The agent will:
1. Use `pipe_builder` to construct the pipeline definition
2. Use `pipe_runner` to execute it with your inputs
3. Return structured interview questions and analysis

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

We are actively working on improving these aspects:

## Logging Configuration

The current logging system has some limitations:
- Difficulty in redirecting logs to specific files
- Limited control over log formatting and destinations
- No built-in log rotation or management

We're planning to implement a more robust logging system in future updates.

## Long-Running Pipelines

For pipelines that take longer than the MCP client timeout to complete, we need to implement a session ID system. This would allow:
- Handling of timeouts gracefully
- Resuming pipeline execution
- Status tracking for long-running operations

This feature is planned for future releases to better support extended pipeline operations.

## Instability

It is not stable yet. The inputs are not always correctly parsed.
